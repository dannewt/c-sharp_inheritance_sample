# c-sharp_inheritance_sample
Demo of a simple game created using object inheritance in C#

A generic "employee" class is created as the base for a "boss" and "trainee" class. The console app allows a user input for employee name, salary, and in the case of a boss, a company car.

The more employees added under the boss' reports, the less revenue the boss brings in.

The code is intended to display an understanding of OOP principles, with inheritance, and virtual/override keywords.
